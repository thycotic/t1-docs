# Organization Credential Procedures

An **app credential** is a client ID & client secret that, say, Secret Server Cloud would use to  connect to Thycotic One and authenticate against it. It can also be  used to push user accounts into Thycotic One – so for example, SSC syncs its user account list with Thycotic One if that option is enabled – all those  users will belong to the original organization, which is set up for them when they provision the instance.
