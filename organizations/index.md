# Organizations

An Thycotic organization is a group of users and app credentials. Each organization is subordinate to a Cloud Manager team. Owner or technical managers in that team can administer the organization, along with any others in that team. Thus, the organization's team membership allows them to create new application credentials, set password strength policies, set 2FA requirements, trigger password resets for their users, and more.  Any user that is added to Thycotic One using application credentials that belong to an organization is also added to that organization.
