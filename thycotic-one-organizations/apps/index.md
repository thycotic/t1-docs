# Thycotic One Organization Applications

Organization *applications* are subscriptions (SSC instances), products (other Thycotic cloud products), Thycotic on-premises applications, or even third-party cloud or on-premises applications that run under Thycotic One single sign on, that is, to appear on your Thycotic One log on page. The configured applications appear on your Thycotic One log on page. 

<!--

> **Note:** It is possible to have subscriptions and products that are *not* applications—applications are integrated with the Thycotic One log on.
