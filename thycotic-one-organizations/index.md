# Thycotic One Organizations

A Thycotic One *organization* is a group of users and application credentials. Each organization is subordinate to a single Cloud Manager team. Owners or technical managers in a team can administer that team's organizations. Organization admins can  configure log on behavior for all their end users. They can create new application credentials, set password strength policies, set 2FA requirements, trigger password resets for their users, and more.  

> **Note:** Any user that is added to Thycotic One using application credentials that belong to an organization are automatically added to that organization.

> **Note:** Please see [Cloud Manager Teams](../cloud-manager-teams/index.md) to contrast with organizations. Teams apply to Cloud Manager and organizations apply to Thycotic One. Team ownership of specific organizations bridge the two.
